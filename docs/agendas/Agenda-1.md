*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Questions for the TA
- [ ]  do we need to keep the user logged in?
- [ ]  when starting the app, do we have an empty database? (just like it would be like if we gave it to another university to use for example)
- [ ]  should we use an organisation tool (like notion/trello) or just use gitlab issues thing?

# Questions for the CTA
- [ ]  do rooms need "facilities"? (ex: has board, has PCs, type of room)
- [ ]  do bikes need time slots? (or can they be rented for an unlimited period)
- [ ]  do we need to filter food on availability?
- [ ]  do bikes need a location/name/code?
- [ ]  do food stores need a location/name/code?
- [ ]  do food products need photos/name/what they are made of?
- [ ]  should you be able to order food anytime or only when you have reserved a room? (like order food after you made the reservation, or not even have a reservation at all to order food)

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
