Up to date for now.

# GitLab Issues
- There is a way to make merge requests when moving the issues from one board to another (in our example from Doing to Reviewing)
- You can link commits to issues by writing #issue_number in your commit message (usually done at the end).
- You can close an issue by writing "Closes #issue_number" or multiple issues ("Closes #issue_number1, #issue_number2")
- More issue tricks at https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/

# GitLab Merge Requests
- You can comment a line to start review for a merge request (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviewing_and_managing_merge_requests.html#perform-inline-code-reviews)
- You can make changes to the merge request and the creator of the merge request can just click approve.

# Tests
- Research what and how mock tests can be made (mock database for client side).

# Design patterns
- Read up on https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog?fbclid=IwAR3jBO34iCO5jA66ixB_Fgh4TOcSQaLcGAhVkeguR-C13b4LkN0ufGGwPYg
